[{"id":1,"nombre": "boss-monster","status": "disponible", "url": "https://images.app.goo.gl/7TcehGW8M9cZEqLH9", "description":"inspired by a love of classic video games, Boss Monster is a ''dungeon-building'' card game that pits 2-4 players in a competition to build the ultimate side-scrolling dungeon. Players compete to lure and destroy hapless adventurers, racing to outbid one another to see who can build the most enticing, treasure-filled dungeon.The goal of Boss Monster is to be the first Boss to amass ten Souls, which are gained when a Hero is lured and defeated. But a player can also lose if his Boss takes five Wounds from Heroes who survive his dungeon.Playing Boss Monster requires you to juggle two competing priorities: the need to lure Heroes at a faster rate than your opponents, and the need to kill those Heroes before they reach your Boss. Players can build one room per turn, each with its own damage and treasure value. More attractive rooms tend to deal less damage, so a Boss who is too greedy can become inundated with deadly Heroes.Players interact with each other by building rooms and playing Spells. Because different Heroes seek different treasure types, and rooms are built simultaneously (played face down, then revealed). This means that every ''build phase'' is a bidding war. Spells are instant-speed effects that can give players advantages or disrupt opponents.As a standalone card game with 150 cards, Boss Monster contains everything that 2-4 players need to play."},

Players try to have the most points at the end of the game by creating beautiful garden paths for their visitors. The deck has 80 cards in ten different colors, with each color featuring a different species of tree; each color has cards numbered 1 through 8, and the number of colors used depends on the number of players. Players start with a hand of seven cards. On each turn, a player draws two cards (from the deck or one or more of the discard piles), lays a card on the table as part of her arboretum, then discards a card to her personal discard pile. When the deck is exhausted, players compare the cards that remain in their hands to determine who can score each color. For each color, the player with the highest value of cards in hand of that color scores for a path of trees in her arboretum that begins and ends with that color; a path is a orthogonally adjacent chain of cards with increasing values. For each card in a path that scores, the player earns one point; if the path consists solely of trees of the color being scored, the player scores two points per card. If a player doesn't have the most value for a color, she scores zero points for a path that begins and ends with that color. Whoever has the most points wins."},
